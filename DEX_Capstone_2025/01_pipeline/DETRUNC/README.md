The DETRUNC adjustment applies to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data specifically, probabilistically assigning 3-digit International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes in MEPS to one of ~150 causes of health spending, so that further analysis may be performed at the cause-level. As such, the DETRUNC adjustment is analogous to the CAUSEMAP adjustment, with the exception that, because MEPS ICD codes are only 3-digits long (not specific enough to be assigned to a single cause), it is necessary to probabilistically assign each 3-digit ICD code to one of many possible causes. (The idea behind the name of this adjustment is that it originally functioned by "de-truncating" MEPS ICD codes, or restoring them to their full 5+ digit length, before mapping them to a cause. While this "detruncation" doesn't actually happen anymore, as the process has been simplified to assign 3-digit ICD codes directly to causes, the original name stuck). This step also applies the PRIMARY_CAUSE adjustment to the MEPS data.
