The CAUSEMAP adjustment assigns each International Classification of Disease (ICD) code in our data to one of ~150 causes of health spending (acause), so that further analysis may be performed at the cause-level. In addition, for prescribed pharmaceuticals, this step probabilistically assigns all data with National Drug Codes (NDC) to the same ~150 causes of health spending. Finally (and crucially), this step determines which columns from the formatted data are preserved for later steps.
